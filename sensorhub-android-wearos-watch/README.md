### OpenSensorHub WearOS App
This WearOS app is designed to be used with the OpenSensorHub SmartHub app for Android devices. It receives data from the WearOS device and sends it to the paired Android device running OpenSensorHub. Please ensure that the phone and the WearOS device are paired, following the instructions provided by the manufacturer.

Note that this app has no configuration options; configuration is done via the OpenSensorHub SmartHub app on the Android device. The WearOS app will automatically start sending data to the Android device when it is started and will run in the background. After the app has been started once, it will continue to transmit data to the Android device, even after the WearOS device has been restarted.

The UI of the WearOS app is minimal. If you see the message "No observations" on the screen, it means that the Android device is not currently receiving data from the WearOS device, in which case you should ensure that the OpenSensorHub SmartHub app is running on the Android device and that the WearOS driver is enabled in the settings of the SmartHub app. When connected, this message will not be displayed. Below the message, the WearOS app will display the latest observations. If the outputs have been disabled via the OpenSensorHub app, the observations will instead display "--". If you have not given the WearOS app permissions, the observations will display "No perms".
